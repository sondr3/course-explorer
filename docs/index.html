    <h1>Course dependencies</h1>
    <p>
      The result of a question, can you visualize the dependencies/recommended courses at UiB? Turns out, yes! This
      visualization was hacked together quickly, you can hover over the blobs and see which course it is. The bigger the
      blob the more courses mention it. You can move around by pressing and dragging, and if you want to you can also
      click and drags the blobs around. If you want to show <em>all</em> courses press the button below the
      visualization, just beware that your PC will hate you.
